# Generating the manifest

The manifest is generated with the script [`utils-and-scripts`](../utils-and-scripts/generate-manifest.py).

> Notes:
> - This can only check a local copy of the S3 bucket. Future enhancements should enable it to check the bucket live
> - There is also a copy of the manifest and this script at the top level of the S3 bucket
